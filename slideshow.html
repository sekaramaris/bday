                        <p>we used to be so young and naive and prone to try everything. and honestly, i am glad we did.</p>
                        <p>weve made countless memories, and no one can ever replace that.</p>
                        <p>no one makes me value my friendship more than you, and you are still my greatest gift, bihah.</p>

                        <p>we really did grow together. i may not show it frequently through words, but i am so glad that you are in my life.</p>
                        <p>i will never feel too lonely knowing that you are still alive and breathing.</p>
                        <p>i wish to god that you will forever be in my life. if you are gone, i will never recover, and no one can replace your place in my heart.</p>

                        <p>you have always been so patient with me, with all the talking and crazy unhinged stuff you never complained, yet you put up with everything.</p>
                        <p>because of you, i feel so comfortable with myself that i assumed others would be the same too, but they are not.</p>
                        <p>no one understands me better than you, and i have never felt anxious or self-conscious around you like i do with other people.</p>
                        <p>who would have thought that you would be the person who knows me the best when our first meeting was so random? but i guess thats how awesome life is.</p>
